However, I want to clarify that it doesn't seem to be directly related to the shipping costs applied to the original order: when I create a return via ISELL, it's no longer linked to the original order, so the problem isn't due to a calculation error or a problem with the shipping costs being applied to the order.\n\nHowever, it has been observed that these issues primarily affect business customers since the pricing change. The question then arises as to whether there could be an indirect link (configuration, permissions, data flow, etc.) or not.\n\nHow many users are affected?: all\n\nHow many stores are affected?
