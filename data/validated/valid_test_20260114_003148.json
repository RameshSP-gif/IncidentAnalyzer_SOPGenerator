However, I want to clarify that it doesn't seem to be directly related to the shipping costs applied to the original order: when I create a return via ISELL, it's no longer linked to the original order, so the problem isn't due to a calculation error or a problem with the shipping costs being applied to the order.\n\nHowever, it has been observed that these issues primarily affect business customers since the pricing change. The question then arises as to whether there could be an indirect link (configuration, permissions, data flow, etc.) or not.\n\nHow many users are affected?: all\n\nHow many stores are affected?

These hanging reservations were not automatically cleared, causing inconsistencies in the stock records. To prevent issues during inventory processing and stock calculations, the reservations were manually removed from the database.\nImpact: The affected articles were incorrectly displayed as \"reserved\" in the system, resulting in inaccurate stock availability information. This led to potential stock mismatches and could have impacted order fulfillment and inventory operations.\nWorkaround: Manually removed the hanging reservations by detaching them from the respective articles in the system to restore correct stock visibility and prevent further discrepancies.\nResolution steps taken / Solution / Fix / Preventative action:\n1. Logged in to the mentioned store database.\n2. Identified the affected reservations and validated their expiry dates.\n3. Confirmed reservation validity and source status using ISELL or ISOM.\n4. Removed expired or invalid reservations from the item_reservation table.\n5. Adjusted the reserved stock values for the affected articles to ensure accuracy.\n6. Committed the changes to the system to finalize updates.\n7. Verified that the stock availability data was accurate post-adjustment.\nPreventive Measures:\n1. Implement an automated cleanup job to remove expired or invalid reservations on a scheduled basis.\n2. Introduce validation logic to flag hanging reservations before inventory execution.\n3. Periodically review the item_reservation table to identify any data inconsistencies.\n4. Provide operational training to ensure timely handling of reservation anomalies.\nKnowledge Object:For reference, check KB article  KB0030415.\nProblem Ticket:There is no active problem ticket for this issue.",

Later there was a modification and deliveryNo was changed to 13, but in ISOM console we can see deliveryNo 4 is still in created status instead of cancelled and the items are connected to it.\nIn this case ideally deliveryNo 4 should be in cancelled status and items should be connected to deliveryNo 13.\n\nAttached modification request kindly verify and let us know what the issue in the payload was and let us know what is expected request for this order. If there is any change in the delivery line like when a new deliveryNo is sent during modification overriding the previous delivery do you expect us to send Action 'cancel' for previously booked delivery??",
